## Enabling Neural Network Inference for Smart IoT Edge Sensor Nodes

Installation

Make sure python3 is installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

In command line run `git clone https://github.com/DanielMcSheehy/SeniorDesign2018.git`


Download `http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz`.
Copy the path of the download to main.py into line 14 (eventually there will be a script to do this).

Then run `python3 main.py`
